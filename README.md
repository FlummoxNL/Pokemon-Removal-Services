# Pokémon Removal Services

A long, long summer ago (2016), when *Pokémon Go* was new, there grew a need for a company to clear out all those pesky Pokémon: [Pokemon Removal Services](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FlummoxNL/Pokemon-removal-Services/blob/master/www/index.html).

All [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) things belong to their owner(s), this was made just for giggles.
